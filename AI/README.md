About AutiLearn
AutiLearn is an innovative, AI-driven learning platform designed to help children with autism develop essential skills in biology. By leveraging the power of AI, AutiLearn provides a fun and engaging learning experience tailored to the unique needs of each child.

All our AI features are based on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). This means that we aren't just doing prompt engineering; we have constructed a knowledge base containing a curated list of  articles related to Science (Biology , Physics ..) for kids . We use this knowledge base in all features to provide well-informed answers. You can check the /notebooks directory to see the notebook for populating the vector base

Overview of Retrieval Augmented Generation
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines the strengths of retrieval-based and generation-based approaches. When we receive an input, we perform a similarity search in our vector database to find relevant documents. These documents are then used to craft a well-informed prompt, which is processed to generate a grounded and accurate response.

Below is a diagram illustrating the RAG process:
