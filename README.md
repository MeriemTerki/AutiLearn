# AutiLearn
## üí° Inspiration
The challenges faced by children with autism in traditional educational settings served as a catalyst for AutiLearn. We observed a significant gap in providing tailored learning experiences that addressed their unique needs. Recognizing the potential of technology to revolutionize education, we were inspired to create a platform that could offer personalized, engaging, and effective learning opportunities. Our goal was to empower autistic children to reach their full potential by providing them with the tools and support they deserve.
