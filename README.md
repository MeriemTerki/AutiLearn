# AutiLearn
## üí° Inspiration
The challenges faced by children with autism in traditional educational settings served as a catalyst for AutiLearn. We observed a significant gap in providing tailored learning experiences that addressed their unique needs. Recognizing the potential of technology to revolutionize education, we were inspired to create a platform that could offer personalized, engaging, and effective learning opportunities. Our goal was to empower autistic children to reach their full potential by providing them with the tools and support they deserve.

## ‚ú® What it does
AutiLearn is a groundbreaking e-learning platform designed specifically for children with autism. We leverage the power of Large Language Models to create a personalized and engaging learning experience.

### Key Features:
- **Personalized Learning Paths:** AutiLearn provides custom learning paths tailored to kids with autism.
- **Interactive Content:** AutiLearn offers engaging lessons, quizzes, and stories designed to capture children's attention and reinforce learning.
- **Reward System:** To boost motivation, AutiLearn incorporates a reward system where children earn virtual coins for completing tasks. These coins can be used to unlock exciting stories and create a sense of accomplishment.
- **AI Chatbot:** AutiLearn has an AI-powered chatbot that serves as a virtual learning companion, answering questions, providing explanations, and fostering curiosity. It goes beyond the curriculum to support children's exploration of different topics.

## üõ†Ô∏è How we built it
- **UI Design:** Figma.
- **Artificial intelligence:** Gemini and Cohere APIs, Pinecone, Python, Render.
- **Web development:** ReactJS, Firebase, PostgreSQL, TailwindCSS.

## üíó What's next for AutiLearn
- **Podcasts feature:** The AI API will have another endpoint to generate micro-podcasts related to the learning paths. We acknowledge that some kids with autism are more into auditory learning.
- **Content creation platform:** To maximize AutiLearn's impact, we're developing a content creation platform for parents and teachers. Users can upload educational PDFs, and our AI will transform them into engaging accessible courses, quizzes, and stories. These custom learning paths can then be added to a child's AutiLearn account.
- **Mobile app version:** To enhance accessibility and user experience, we are developing a dedicated AutiLearn mobile app.
